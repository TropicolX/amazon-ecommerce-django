// ISSUES I FACED AND THEIR SOLUTIONS
- Installing Pillow: Install it via MSY2 MINGW and copy the pillow package from the mingw64 folder to your
project's venv folder

- Writing custom api views: Read the restframework docs and try to overwrite generic views with custom 
functionality rather than creating custom views from scratch

- Finding how to do a certain thing: Google, StackOverflow, search Github for similar projects, ask seniors
for help, experiment.
